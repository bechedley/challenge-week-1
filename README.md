# Week One Challenge: User Accessibility

## Description

This repository is where I refactor code for the Horiseon marketing agency to enable greater user accessibility and enhanced search engine optimisation (SEO). In doing so, I have updated the html and css files to meet current accessibility standards, particularly in regards to alt attributes, logical structure and sequencing. I have also converted heading sizes to relative percentages, and updated the html and css files to follow a logical semantic structure.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

User accessibility features can be found by opening the web page in a Chrome browser and using the Inspect option to access the Chrome Developer Tools.
